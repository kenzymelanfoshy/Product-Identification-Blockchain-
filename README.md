# Fake-Product-Identification-Using-DAPP-on-BlockChain
This repository houses the codebase and resources for an advanced decentralized application (DAPP) engineered to detect and authenticate counterfeit products utilizing blockchain technology. The project employs smart contracts to establish a secure and transparent mechanism for verifying product authenticity. Through this DAPP, users can register products on the blockchain, enabling consumers to validate product details and ensuring the integrity and legitimacy of their purchases. This sophisticated solution is designed to combat the proliferation of counterfeit goods, thereby safeguarding consumers and businesses from fraudulent activities.
