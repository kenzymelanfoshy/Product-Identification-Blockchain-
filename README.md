# Fake-Product-Identification-Using-DAPP-on-BlockChain
This repository contains the code and resources for a decentralized application (DAPP) designed to identify and authenticate fake products using blockchain technology. The project leverages smart contracts to provide a secure and transparent method for verifying the authenticity of products. Users can register products on the blockchain, and consumers can verify product details using the DAPP, ensuring the integrity and legitimacy of their purchases. The solution aims to combat counterfeit goods and protect consumers and businesses from fraud.
